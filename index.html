      <p>There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds.Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen,and are the basis of most of Earth's
        ecosystems. Plants that produce grain, fruit and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great
        variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.</p>
